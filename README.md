A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that hides sessions in your world list based on host userID/username or sessionID and can also hide stuck sessions. A stuck session is one that appears in the session list but doesn't actually exist and cannot be joined.

Configure with [Neos Mod Settings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings).

This resolves this Neos issue: https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3483

And also this one: https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3563

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [WorldListSessionHider.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/NeosWorldListSessionHider/releases/download/v1.2.1/WorldListSessionHider.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
