A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that visually hides session info and thumbnails in your session browser based on host userID/username or sessionID, and can also hide stuck sessions. A stuck session is one that appears in the session list but doesn't actually exist and cannot be joined.

This does not prevent other people from seeing your sessions! It is purely a local change"

Configure with [Resonite Mod Settings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings).

This resolves this Neos issue: https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3483

And also this one: https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3563

You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
