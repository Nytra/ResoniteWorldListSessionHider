A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that hides session info and thumbnails in your session browser based on the host's userID/username or the sessionID, and can also hide stuck sessions. A stuck session is one that appears in the session list but doesn't actually exist and cannot be joined.

This does not prevent other people from seeing your sessions! It is purely a local change that only the mod user can see.

Configure with [Resonite Mod Settings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings).

You can choose to display sessions with no thumbnail and info removed like in the image above or you can hide them completely so they will not show up at all.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [WorldListSessionHider.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/ResoniteWorldListSessionHider/releases/latest/download/WorldListSessionHider.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
